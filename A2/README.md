# Assignments
- Download a road network of the Porto City, Portugal and download some trajectory data of taxies in the city from a Kaggle competition.

- Visualize the raw GPS points of the first 10 trips in the trajectory data dataset on a map with the road network of Porto (together with different colors or separately).

- Perform the map matching task to map the trajectory data to the road network using an
existing open-source tool. Each trajectory will be mapped to a sequence of road segments and we call a sequence of road segments a route.

- Visualize the routes that are mapped from the trajectories of the first 10 trips on the road
network (together with different colors or separately).

- Perform some analysis on the mapped routes. This includes (1) to return 5 road segments that are traversed the most often as indicated by the trajectory data; (2) to return 5 road
segments, whose average travelling time as indicated by the trajectory data are the largest (those road segments that are traversed by no trajectories can be ignored); and (3) and visualize the
road segments returned in (1) and (2) on the road network separately.
